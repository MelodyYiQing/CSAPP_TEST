CS:APP Learning Blog & Semester sumary
==
To DouDou：这个日志是我用我蹩脚的英语写的，虽然不怎么样，但我努力了。就检查作业而言，这里有六个课堂的实验，和两个CMU课后的实验作业，datalab我跟完了，bomblab最后一关实在不会写，看别人的我也没咋明白（挠头）。大实验的日志写的比较认真，有解题的心路，课堂的实验就写了一点感想。

This semester I had learnt some part of the CS:APP.So cosidering my performance score(this blog is part of the score)and also for following review,here I write some understanding about all the programs we ran this semester and the two projects of the CMU(datalab & bomblab).It's my first time to write a learning blog with my poor english,so just read it for fun.
<br>Some of the programs are cited from our class ppts,but I carefully write the annotation.Also I do the 2 tests (datalab&bomblab)from CMU.
<br>`Since I'm still confused about how to use the github to write a goodlooking blog.All that I want to convey is added to the annotation above or below the code blocks.`
