CS:APP Learning Blog & Semester sumary
==
This semester I had learnt some part of the CS:APP.So cosidering my performance score(this blog is part of the score)and also for following review,here I write some understanding about all the programs we ran this semester and the two projects of the CMU(datalab & bomblab).It's my first time to write a learning blog with my poor english,so just read it for fun.
<br>Some of the programs are cited from our class ppts,but I carefully write the annotation.
